This Shiny app uses the GAPMINDER data set to explore the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy across countries.

The Shiny app has two reactive inputs.  The first is a slider that allows the user to set a minimum GDP per Capita figure, which serves as a filter limiting the number of countries and data points that populate the graphs.  The second is a radio button selection that allows the user to choose what continent to focus on.  If one selects Africa, for example, only countries from Africa will appear in the graphs.

The Shiny app includes four different tabs on the User Interface:
1.  The Scatter Plot tab plots GDP vs Life Expectancy for the countries in the continent selected.  The graph also includes the plot for a linear model.
2.  The Time Series Tab shows the life expectancy by year for the countries included.
3.  The Box Plot tab contains a box plot of life expectancy for the countries included.
4.  The Data Table tab inclues all the rows of data included based on the selected filters.

Any changes by the user to either the GDP slider or the continent radio buttons will result in immediate updates to the 4 tabs as a result of reactive expressions in the shiny app.
